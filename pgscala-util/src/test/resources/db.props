;  We need a valid database to connect to in order to test pgscala-util functionality.
;  To create a dummy role and database for testing, run the following commands as the postgres superuser:
;
;  CREATE ROLE pgscalautil PASSWORD 'changeit' LOGIN;
;  COMMENT ON ROLE pgscalautil IS 'Test role for PGScalaUtil';
;  CREATE DATABASE pgscalautil_test OWNER pgscalautil ENCODING 'utf8' TEMPLATE template1;
;  COMMENT ON DATABASE pgscalautil_test IS 'Test database for PGScalaUtil';
;
;  To delete the dummy database and role at a later time, run the following cleanup:
;
;  DROP DATABASE pgscalautil_test;
;  DROP ROLE pgscalautil;

host   = localhost           ; enter localhost, a FQDN or an IP address
port   = 5432                ; currently default port
dbname = pgscalautil_test    ; database to connect to
user   = pgscalautil         ; role username
pass   = changeit            ; role password
